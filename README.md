Hi, everyone! I am Tatsuya. I am a full-time student in Tokyo, Japan. I am also a research student seeking a Bachelor of Electrical, Electronic, and Communication Engineering.
I am learning C++, Python, and Web App Languages(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). 
I am glad to reach out to everyone on Github to pave the way for the IT development. 

Thank you for reading my biref profile. 

If you get interested in me even a little, feel free to message me!
