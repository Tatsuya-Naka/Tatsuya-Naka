## About me
### Hi! I'm Tatsuya, studying Computer Science at the University of Sydney
・I'm learning Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, and Flask
・I researched in the biomedical & medical engineering to develop a software for rehabilitation training of Electric gloves that enables finger movement synchronized with the user's motor intention, using C/C++, windows API, Arduino, and M5 Series. I also created a GUI (Graphical User interface) for medical staff. (I cannot provide this because this is a collaborative research with the University of California, Irvine.
