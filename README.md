## About me
### Hi! I'm Tatsuya, studying Computer Science at the University of Sydney
・I’m currently learning Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, and Flask.

・I conducted research in biomedical and medical engineering, focusing on developing software for rehabilitation training with electric gloves. This system enables finger movement synchronized with the user's motor intentions, using C/C++, Windows API, Arduino, and M5 Series. Additionally, I created a graphical user interface (GUI) for medical staff. (Please note that I cannot provide this work as it was part of a collaborative research project with the University of California, Irvine.)
