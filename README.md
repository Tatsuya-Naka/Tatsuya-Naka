## About me
### Hi! I'm Tatsuya, studying Computer Science at the University of Sydney
I’m currently learning Cloud Computing and Machine Learning.

I’m a solution-focused Full Stack & Infrastructure Engineer currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Sydney, with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Communication Engineering from Chuo University, where I graduated in the top 2% of my cohort.

With hands-on experience across the full development lifecycle, I’ve worked on production-scale applications like SpotsNinja (100K+ users), contributing to core features and backend integrations using TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails. I also implemented CI/CD pipelines and AWS-based release monitoring systems, improving development workflow reliability for a project, I am working on personally.

Beyond app development, I have strong interests and experience in cloud infrastructure and DevOps. I’ve built infrastructure using Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions, and deployed full-stack apps to AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront, ECR, RDS, ElastiCache, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, AppRunner, SNS, SQS, Lambda). I hold the AWS Certified Developer – Associate credential and am actively building infrastructure-focused projects to deepen my expertise.
